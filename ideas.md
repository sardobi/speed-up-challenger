# Ideas

- [ ] Title screen
- [ ] Countdown to race start
- [ ] Lose condition when other players all complete however many laps
- [ ] Patronising "Good effort" screen when losing (golf clap?)
- [ ] More pop-up prompts to speed up
- [ ] Patronising floating arrow pointing to the Challenger after a certain amount of time still
- [ ] Confusing animated button prompt (e.g. showing a button with `FAST` written on it)
